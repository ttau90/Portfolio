# MVC with Android (Java)

### Project Background
The objective for this project was to create a basic android app that would prompt the user for a search term and location.  The app would then contact a server that would handle the main processing of querying Yelp's API to return the 3 closest restaurants.

The server would also record all search terms and restaurant ratings to a MongoDB database.  These basic statistics would be then displayed in a dashboard on the server.
